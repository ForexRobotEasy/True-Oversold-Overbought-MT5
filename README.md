# True Oversold Overbought MT5

This is a code snippet for the True Oversold Overbought MT5 trading strategy. It is a multi-currency trading strategy that identifies oversold and overbought levels using the RSI indicator and executes buy or sell orders accordingly.

## How it Works

The code defines a list of currency pairs to test the strategy on. It then checks if there are multiple currency pairs in the list and loops through each symbol to call the trading function. If there is only one currency pair, it directly calls the trading function for that pair.

In the trading function, the code checks if the symbol is supported by checking the bid price. If the symbol is supported, it implements the trading strategy. In this example, the strategy is to buy when the RSI indicator is below the oversold level (30) and sell when it is above the overbought level (70). It uses the `iRSI` function to calculate the RSI indicator value for the current symbol and compares it with the oversold and overbought levels.

If the RSI value is below the oversold level, a buy order is executed using the `OrderSend` function. If the RSI value is above the overbought level, a sell order is executed. The code uses the bid price for buy orders and the ask price for sell orders.
